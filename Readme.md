Title: Learning Human Activities from Body-Worn Motion and Magnetic Sensor Data

- Human Activity Classification into 19 activities performed by eight subjects (4 female, 4 male, between the ages 20 and 30) for 5 minutes. We have used the dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Daily+and+Sports+Activities

### The 19 activities are as follows: 

Sitting (A1), 
Standing (A2), 
Lying on back and on right side (A3 and A4), 
Ascending and descending stairs (A5 and A6), 
Standing in an elevator still (A7) and moving around in an elevator (A8), 
Walking in a parking lot (A9), 
Walking on a treadmill with a speed of 4 km/h (in flat and 15 deg inclined positions) (A10 and A11), 
Running on a treadmill with a speed of 8 km/h (A12), 
Exercising on a stepper (A13), 
Exercising on a cross trainer (A14), 
Cycling on an exercise bike in horizontal and vertical positions (A15 and A16), 
Rowing (A17), 
Jumping (A18), 
Playing basketball (A19)

The subjcts have sensors on torso (T), right arm (RA), left arm (LA), right leg (RL), left leg (LL) with a total of 9 sensors on each (x,y,z accelerometers, x,y,z gyroscopes, x,y,z magnetometers). 


#### Please refer to the Machine learning_Project.ipynb Notebook for codes and outputs
#### The theory and discussion are provided in the Report.pdf file
#### Signal processing analysis involving filter impulse response, processing and data frequency response is done in the .mat files in the 'Analysis of Data Processing' folder. The folder includes figures and code for the same
